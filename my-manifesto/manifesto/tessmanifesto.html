 <h1> My Manifesto </h1>

<p>
    <span class="fun-quote1">This is your</span> <span class="huge"> life.</span>
    Do what you <span class="big">Love,</span> and do it often.

    <span class="fun-quote2">If you don’t like something, change it.</span>
    <strong>Life is short.</strong>
    <span class="fun-quote3">If you don’t like your job, quit.</span> If you don’t have enough time, stop watching TV.
    <span class="fun-quote4"> some opportunities only come once, seize them.</span>
    <span class="fun-quote5">If you are looking for the love of your life, stop; They will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love.</span>
   Stop over analyzing, life is simple. All emotions are beautiful.
      <span class="fun-quote6">When you eat, appreciate every last bite.</span>
    <strong>Lions do not lose sleep over the opinions of sheep.</strong>
    <span class="fun-quote7">Open your mind, arms, and heart to new things and people, we are united in our differences.</span>
    <em>Life is about the people you meet, and the things you create with them so go out and get stared creating.</em>
    <span class="fun-quote1">Travel often; getting lost will help you find yourself. </span>
